# PokeStats App

This is a simple React application that consumes the PokeAPI to show the stats of different Pokemons. It uses Vite as the build tool, MUI (Material UI) for styling, and React Router for navigation.

## Usage

The app has two pages. The first page is the home page with a landing, and the second page is where you can select the desired Pokemon and view its stats.

### Navbar

The navbar component can be found in `src/components/NavBar.jsx`. It uses `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` to navigate to the different pages in the app.

### Home Page

The home page can be accessed by navigating to the root URL (`/`). It has a simple landing that welcomes the user and provides a button to navigate to the Pokemon stats page.

### Pokemon Stats Page

The Pokemon stats page can be accessed by navigating to `/pokemons`. On this page, there is an input field where you can search for the desired Pokemon. Once you have entered the name of the Pokemon, press the "Submit" button. This will use the `useParams` hook to display the stats of the selected Pokemon.
